Revision history for MooseX-Workers
0.03  Mon Oct 1 2007
        - Moved worker_started into an event so add_worker returns
          before it's called (dec)
        - Can now pass arguments to spawn() which are passed as
          ProgramArgs to the underlying POE::Wheel (dec)
		- Fixed a bug where worker_start was actually calling worker_stop 
		  in the visitor (thanks to ash and perlmonkey2 for noticing)
		- new spawn() interface that returns the Wheel ID and PID
